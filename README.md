Some resources for emergency and safety

Zines to go with whistles:

The design environment:

In priority order:

- Production volume - demand right now is outstripping production - the penne whistles fit more to a plate

- Printability (obviously feeds into #1) - speed, filament use, bridging etc - wide variety of printing capabilities mean not all models are going to be universally ideal (flat ones definitely present some bridging challenges)

- Usability - bright colors are good for organizers to identify allies

- Usability - phone number - organizers have expressed a preference for the phone number, it has two drawbacks: the phone number is permanent and geographically unique and it may also introduce printability issues (even the embossed one from my modifications to the lozenge-shaped design or with a filament change)

Unknowns:

- I have not heard any issues regarding the design for the size of holes with lanyards etc

- No complaints about filament material - I have printed a bunch of both PLA and PETG, no feedback on problems there either way

In addition to the whistles in this repo that I modified to include the local New Orleans rapid response phone number, here is a whistle that is great for printing in large volumes: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1957165-safety-whistle-public-domain-small-penne-style#profileId-2103565
