Whistle FAQ:

Q. Which whistle should I print?

A. The loudest whistle you can print reliably in the most quantities

Q. How do I do that?

A. Print the lozenge whistle, either the original one or one of the number variants.  Print other whistles from makerworld, printables or this repo and compare them.  Print as many as you can and get connected so they can be distributed into the community.

Q. Should I print one with the rapid response number?

A. Organizers have expressed that they like having that number there.  But that number is regionally specific, so it does limit ability to send whistles elsewhere.

The design environment:

In priority order:

- Production volume - demand right now is outstripping production - the penne whistles fit more to a plate

- Printability (obviously feeds into #1) - speed, filament use, bridging etc - wide variety of printing capabilities mean not all models are going to be universally ideal (flat ones definitely present some bridging challenges)

- Usability - bright colors are good for organizers to identify allies

- Usability - phone number - organizers have expressed a preference for the phone number, it has two drawbacks: the phone number is permanent and geographically unique and it may also introduce printability issues (even the embossed one from my modifications to the lozenge-shaped design or with a filament change)

Unknowns:

- I have not heard any issues regarding the design for the size of holes with lanyards etc

- No complaints about filament material - I have printed a bunch of both PLA and PETG, no feedback on problems there either way

In addition to the whistles in this repo that I modified to include the local New Orleans rapid response phone number, here is a whistle that is great for printing in large volumes: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1957165-safety-whistle-public-domain-small-penne-style#profileId-2103565
